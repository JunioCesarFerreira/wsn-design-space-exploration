These results were obtained using the `batch_runner` script in conjunction with the Cooja network simulator.

### Experimental Procedure

The experimental workflow is summarized as follows:

1. **Cooja Environment Setup**  
   Prepare a containerized environment with Contiki-NG and Cooja. Detailed setup instructions can be found in:
   - [cooja-tools](https://github.com/JunioCesarFerreira/cooja-tools)
   - [cooja-docker-vm-setup](https://github.com/JunioCesarFerreira/Cooja-Docker-VM-Setup)

2. **Firmware Deployment**  
   Transfer the compiled firmware binaries to the Cooja container using `scp`. These binaries define the node behavior executed during the simulations.

3. **Input Configuration Preparation**  
   Copy the JSON configuration files into the `input` directory of the [`batch_runner`](../../batch_runner/) module.  
   These JSON files correspond to network configurations generated by the [MILP-based design space exploration](../../milp/mobile-model/) (e.g., outputs from [wsn-milp](https://github.com/JunioCesarFerreira/wsn-milp)).

4. **Batch Simulation Execution**  
   Execute the [`batch_runner`](../../batch_runner/batch_runner.py) script, which automatically:
   - generates the corresponding Cooja simulation files,
   - runs the simulations in batch mode,
   - extracts performance logs, and
   - computes the objective values used in the comparative analysis.

> **Important Note**  
> For meaningful comparison and analysis, it is essential to ensure that the **simulation duration** used in the batch Cooja experiments is **identical** to the simulation time adopted in the SimLab executions. Differences in simulation length may significantly affect accumulated metrics (e.g., throughput and energy consumption), leading to biased or non-comparable results.
